# IPA Keyboard Website
This is the website that allows you to type the IPA characters.  

## To use this, you will first need to download the appropriate file and run it.  You can find all of the releases [here](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Client_with_Robot/releases).  Click on the first release in the list (this is the newest) and download the appropriate file:
- For Windows: download the windows zip file and extract it.  Run the executable file in it.  
- For Linux: download the linux zip (hopefully the fact that it's AMD doesn't matter).  Extract it and run the shell file.  You use Linux, you can figure it out.  
- For MacOS: sorry, this isn't supported yet.  You'll need to compile it yourself.  Go to [processing.org](processing.org) for more information.  

## Usage of the program/website [Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/Dq0mX-xQkGM)
- Run the executable (do this on the computer that you want the characters to be sent to)
- You may get a popup that says you need to install Java.  Clicking OK should bring up a page to install it.  Do this.  
- (Skip if using QR codes) Once you have run the executable file, look in the folder that it's in (and that folder's subfolders) for a file called `config.txt`.
- (Skip if using QR codes) Open it and set your username and password.  All that should be in that file when you're done is a line with your username and a line with your password.  
- (Skip if using QR codes) Once you've done this, close the window that was opened when you ran the program.
- (Skip if using QR codes) Now rerun the program.
- Return to [https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Website/blob/main/index.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Website/blob/main/index.html) on the device that you want to type on.
- Enter the username and password that you entered in `config.txt` into the text entry boxes (or the QR code key into the password box) and click submit.
- The program should be working now!  Simply click the buttons and the characters should appear on the computer that you ran the executable on.

## Questions, Comments, and Issues
- I'll try to check the [Issues](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Client_with_Robot/issues) on [my GitHub](https://github.com/codeBodger), but I make no promisses.  
- The best thing to do would be to open an issue (as mentioned above) and send me an email at [rnackerm+ipa@udel.edu](rnackerm+ipa@udel.edu).  
- Alternatively, if you're in LING 101 with me (you probably know if you are), you can stop me after class, and I'll try to answer your questions then.
