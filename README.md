# IPA Keyboard Website
This is the website that allows you to type the IPA characters.  

## To use this, you will first need to download the appropriate file and run it.  You can find all of the releases [here](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Client_with_Robot/releases).  Click on the first release in the list (this is the newest) and download the appropriate file:
- For Windows: download the Windows executable file and run it.  
- For Linux/MacOS: sorry, this isn't supported yet.  You'll need to download the source and get all of the dependencies yourself.  The information in the release should be helpful.  

## Usage of the program/website [Outdated Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/Dq0mX-xQkGM)
- Run the executable (do this on the computer that you want the characters to be sent to)
- Go to the [login page](https://phonetics.ling.udel.edu/login) on the device that you want to type on.
- Enter the linking code that was generated when you ran the program or clicked `Get New Linking Code` into the text box and click `Login`.
- The program should be working now!  Simply click the buttons and the characters should appear on the computer that you ran the executable on.

## Questions, Comments, and Issues
- I'll try to check the [Issues](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Client_with_Robot/issues) on [my GitHub](https://github.com/codeBodger), but I make no promisses.  
- The best thing to do would be to open an issue (as mentioned above) and send me an email at [rnackerm+ipa@udel.edu](rnackerm+ipa@udel.edu).  
- Alternatively, if you're in LING 202 with me (you probably know if you are), you can stop me after class, and I'll try to answer your questions then.

## Technical Details
This is the Website that users will use to type.  After inputting the linking-code generated by the [Client](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Client_with_Robot?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) into the login page of this website on their secondary device, the user can tap/click the buttons on the chart to type the characters.  If the user inputs an invalid linking-code, they are alerted.  After the linking-code is input successfully, the long-code that was generated when the [Client](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Client_with_Robot?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) was run is sent from the [Router Server](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Router_Server?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) to this Website, completing the linking. 

If the user does not have a secondary device, they can also copy and paste the symbols directly from this Website. 

When the user presses a button (and is logged in), this Website sends data containing the key-code for the button pressed and the long-code to the [Backend](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Website_Backend?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).  If the user is not “logged in”, this will not be sent, so as not to send unnecessary data.

Whenever any data is sent from this Website, it is prepended by a string describing the activity, which the [Backend](https://github.com/codeBodger/IPA_Keyboard_Website_Backend?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) uses to determine what to do with the data (either treat it like a linking-code or like a key-code followed by a long-code).  The activity is separated from the data with a backslash.

| Key‑code:     | the three digit<sub>10</sub> (000-164) code representing a single IPA character        |
| Key‑byte:     | the key-code as a single byte (typically implicitly casted to `int`)                   |
| Long‑code:    | the 18 digit<sub>64</sub> code to indicate which client a key-byte needs to be sent to |
| Linking‑code: | the six digit<sub>10</sub> code to get the long-code from Router Server to Website     |
